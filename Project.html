  <h1>Project Idea</h1>
    <p>I have always liked to tinker around with things since a young age. I would often hang out with my Grandad in his workshop when we visited and help him with whatever job he was working on at the time. I built my first computer when I was about 13 and my passion for IT grew from there. That’s partly how I came up with my idea.</p>
    <p>The IT project idea I came up with was to create a simple light controller that would allow you to create a light show using your Christmas lights. I enjoy hanging up Christmas lights each year and have seen the insane displays that flood social media over the festive period. I have always wanted to create an amazing light show like this but the commercially available equipment to do something like this is quite expensive. That’s when I discovered you can create a simple light controller using a Raspberry Pi and a few other bits and pieces for a fraction of the cost. I thought why not create different DIY hobby kits that are all based around using a Raspberry Pi, one of which would be the light controller for Christmas lights. As I have no real experience with creating something like this, my idea is something that would likely take me several years to complete as I still have quite a few skills to learn/develop first. Studying the Bachelor of Information Technology will help me learn some of the skills I need to be able to complete this. Otherwise I would need to get the help of a group of people to help with the coding and development of the app to control this.</p>
    <p>This idea is a fun creative project to build that I’m sure lots of Christmas light enthusiasts would enjoy, but it doesn’t just have to stop at being a light controller. It could be anything. Similar types of kits have been around for years and provide great learning opportunities. This idea could be expanded into an entire DIY/hobby kit range, using the Raspberry Pi as the main item and then selling different add-ons or software packages to create or do other things. But for now I am just going to focus on the light controller portion.</p>
    <p>I have never used a Raspberry Pi but from what I have read Raspberry Pi OS (previously known as Raspbian) sounds like a great operating system to start with as it includes quite a lot of tools built in. It is also officially supported by the Raspberry Pi Foundation so that gives some confidence in the stability of the OS. After looking into different languages you can use to code in on Raspberry Pi, I think python would be able to do what I need. It is supposed to be one of the easier languages to learn and is quite popular so I would likely be able to find plenty of support and resources to help create my idea. I think I would also need an expansion device for the Raspberry Pi called a PiFace. This device allows you to connect a number of different things to the Raspberry Pi such as lights. To connect the lights to the PiFace you have to cut the current light controller box off the Christmas lights and wire it direct to the PiFace board. This is what will allow the Raspberry Pi to control the different channels of the lights. Once the Raspberry Pi and PiFace is setup with the lights connected to it you would then be able to control it with an application.</p>
    <p>The latest version of Raspberry Pi includes network connectivity which means I won’t need any other hardware to be able to connect it to my home network. By using free software that already exists (VNC by Dexter Industries) I can make the Raspberry Pi accessible on any mobile/tablet on the same network. This way I wouldn’t need to create an app that needs to work on multiple platforms. The devices would be able to access and use the app on the Raspberry Pi kind of like a remote desktop.</p>
    <p>As I don’t have any real knowledge in coding yet I am unsure just how hard it would be to create the program to control the lights, but I have an idea of what I would want it to be able to do. Similar to what you would see in the software that controls the RGB in most computers, I would like to have some pre-set lighting patterns/styles that you could select. There would be a drop-down menu to select these options and then you would simply click a button to apply to the selected pattern. I would also like to make these pre-sets be slightly modifiable by the user by having a speed and brightness slider (where applicable). I would have the pre-set options available to just repeat the one option or randomly scroll through them all. The below image is a rough idea of how this may look.</p>

    <p>I would have an option for users to create a playlist of patterns. This would let users select which patterns they would like to have, the speed and brightness (if applicable to pattern), and the duration each pattern goes for before changing to the next. This playlist would then repeat. The below image is a rough idea of how this may look.</p>

    <p>The software would also have a scheduler. This would eliminate the need to manually turn the lights on or off and would mean that they could be scheduled to run on specific days and times. The below image is a rough idea of how this may look. </p>

    <p>The idea for a light controller may only appeal to a small audience but as just one of potentially limitless parts of a DIY/hobby kit this idea has unlimited potential.</p>
