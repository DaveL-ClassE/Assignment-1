  <p>A job I think that I would like to one day pursue would be a system administrator. There is a lot involved in the role but it entails quite a lot of different aspects of the IT industry which is what I think I like about it. It involves managing and maintaining things such as networks and hardware, installing or configuring hardware and/or software, some troubleshooting/tech support and looking after things like making sure everything is backed up. This is the kind of work I think I would enjoy doing.</p>
  <p>I enjoy the fact that this role could also be quite different each day depending on what is happening. Because you do so many different things you wouldn’t get bored just doing the same task over and over. Another advantage of this role is that you would gain a good knowledge across a lot of aspects of IT so I could potentially move into another more specialised role if I decided that I wanted a change.</p>
  <p>A system administrator role requires experience so it’s not something you could really walk into after completing a Bachelor of Information Technology. It would also require several years in the industry to gain practical experience doing these kinds of things.</p>
  <p>Right now I only have my Higher School Certificate where I studied IT, other than that I don’t have any formal qualifications or skills required for this role which is why I have started study. I do have some knowledge and experience with IT such as setting up/building computers, setting up home networks and troubleshooting various IT issues in my roles at work.</p>
  <p>I am hoping to get an entry level job in IT in early 2023 which will help me start to get hands on experience I need. As I progress with my studies this will help me move forward with my career in IT and by the end of my degree I should have gained enough knowledge to move into higher roles. I am studying part time which means it will take around 6yrs to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology. If I am successful in getting this entry level IT role that will help me gain experience while I study which will hopefully mean that within 10yrs I should be able to achieve this goal.</p>
