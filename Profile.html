  <h1>My Profile</h1>
    <p><img src="images/barney.JPG" alt="Barney" width="200" id="barney"/>My name is David, and I am just beginning my university studies for the Bachelor of Information Technology. I currently work for a retail company where I am the stock controller and also look after health & safety.I also have an 11yr old black Labrador named Barney who still acts like he is about 6 months old.</p>
    <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing some video games or practicing the piano which I am still currently learning. I also have my open water scuba diving licence and have dived in a few interesting places such as Hawaii.</p>
    <p>My interest in IT started when I was in primary school. I enjoyed the small amount of time we would get to play on the class computer and when we were allowed, I would play on the library computers at lunch time. This developed further when I got into high school, where I had IT as a subject for my School Certificate (year 10) and Higher School Certificate (year 12). One of the requirements for the school certificate was doing work experience for 2 weeks toward the end of the year, which I chose to do at a local computer store. I got to help repair and build computers during my that time which I really enjoyed. They even told me to bring in my computer, which I had built, and we could tinker around with it. At home, whenever I had the chance, I would be playing around with our computer or fiddling with electronics. This is when I really decided that I would one day like to have a career somewhere in IT.</p>
    <p>I have never worked directly in an IT role but have had some experience with some aspects of IT. For a few years I worked at Dick Smith Electronics where I was one of the people that would trouble shoot or help fix customers computers instore. I was also a salesperson, so I had to have quite a lot of knowledge about different aspects of computers and technology.</p>
    <p>In my current job there is some general IT work expectations of my role such as setup and troubleshooting of the stores IT equipment (eg. POS computers, printers etc). I like to be involved whenever anything IT related comes up at work as I enjoy it. I decided if I wanted to actually get into a proper IT role I would need to study to get a degree in IT. That’s when I started looking into study options. Because I work full time and couldn’t really afford to cut back, I needed to find something that allowed me to study part time but also at a time that would work for me. I found Open Universities Australia and spoke to the team there, and they recommended RMIT as a great option for what I was looking for.</p>
    <p>I am hoping that by the end of my studies with RMIT I will have a sound knowledge of IT and will be setup to be able to pursue a career somewhere in the field of IT. I don’t really have a specific area of IT that I am sure I want to follow just yet so I am hoping that this course will provide me with a broad knowledge that I can then use to decide which aspect I would like to develop further.</p>
