<h1>My profile</h1>
  <p>My name is David, and I am just beginning my university studies for the Bachelor of Information Technology. I currently work for a retail company where I am the stock controller and also look after health & safety. I also have an 11yr old black Labrador named Barney who still acts like he is about 6 months old.</p>
  <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing some video games or practicing the piano which I am still currently learning. I also have my open water scuba diving licence and have dived in a few interesting places such as Hawaii.</p>
  <p>My interest in IT started when I was in primary school. I enjoyed the small amount of time we would get to play on the class computer and when we were allowed, I would play on the library computers at lunch time. This developed further when I got into high school, where I had IT as a subject for my School Certificate (year 10) and Higher School Certificate (year 12). One of the requirements for the school certificate was doing work experience for 2 weeks toward the end of the year, which I chose to do at a local computer store. I got to help repair and build computers during my that time which I really enjoyed. They even told me to bring in my computer, which I had built, and we could tinker around with it. At home, whenever I had the chance, I would be playing around with our computer or fiddling with electronics. This is when I really decided that I would one day like to have a career somewhere in IT.</p>
  <p>I have never worked directly in an IT role but have had some experience with some aspects of IT. For a few years I worked at Dick Smith Electronics where I was one of the people that would trouble shoot or help fix customers computers instore. I was also a salesperson, so I had to have quite a lot of knowledge about different aspects of computers and technology.</p>
  <p>In my current job there is some general IT work expectations of my role such as setup and troubleshooting of the stores IT equipment (eg. POS computers, printers etc). I like to be involved whenever anything IT related comes up at work as I enjoy it. I decided if I wanted to actually get into a proper IT role I would need to study to get a degree in IT. That’s when I started looking into study options. Because I work full time and couldn’t really afford to cut back, I needed to find something that allowed me to study part time but also at a time that would work for me. I found Open Universities Australia and spoke to the team there, and they recommended RMIT as a great option for what I was looking for.</p>
  <p>I am hoping that by the end of my studies with RMIT I will have a sound knowledge of IT and will be setup to be able to pursue a career somewhere in the field of IT. I don’t really have a specific area of IT that I am sure I want to follow just yet so I am hoping that this course will provide me with a broad knowledge that I can then use to decide which aspect I would like to develop further.</p>


<h1>Ideal Job</h1>

  <p>link to site https://www.seek.com.au/job/58423035?type=standard#sol=7b3b9d3dc61dd3925d571428ff0d7ea281b24836 </p>
  <p>A job I think that I would like to one day pursue would be a system administrator. There is a lot involved in the role but it entails quite a lot of aspects of the IT industry which is what I think I like about it. It involves managing and maintaining things such as networks and hardware, installing or configuring hardware and/or software, some troubleshooting/tech support and looking after things like making sure everything is backed up. This is the kind of work I think I would enjoy doing.</p>
  <p>A system administrator role requires experience so it’s not something you could really walk into after completing a Bachelor of Information Technology. It would also require several years in the industry to gain practical experience doing these kinds of things.</p>
  <p>Right now I only have my Higher School Certificate where I studied IT, other than that I don’t have any formal qualifications or skills required for this role which is why I have started study. I do have some knowledge and experience with IT such as setting up/building computers, setting up home networks and troubleshooting various IT issues in my roles at work.</p>
  <p>I am hoping to get an entry level job in IT in early 2023 which will help me start to get hands on experience I need. As I progress with my studies this will help me move forward with my career in IT and by the end of my degree I should have gained enough knowledge to move into higher roles. I am studying part time which means it will take around 6yrs to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology. If I am successful in getting this entry level IT role that will help me gain experience while I study which will hopefully mean that within 10yrs I should be able to achieve this goal.</p>



<h1>Personality Tests</h1>
  <p>1.	A Myer-Briggs test, where my personality type is a Virtuoso ISTP-T.</p>
  <p> screen shot</p>
  <p>This personality type is very hands on and visual when it comes to things. They are often creative, great in a crisis and optimistic, however they can also be stubborn and easily bored. Virtuosos are also good problem-solvers. I think this is fairly accurate representation of myself. I do prefer to actually do something instead of just read about it and I often come up with weird and wonderful solutions to problems at work. One thing this does highlight is that I am more introverted than extroverted, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does have room for improvement.</p>

  <p>2.	A learning styles test</p>
  <p> screen shot</p>
  <p>This test shows that I learn better by doing things and being hands on. This accounts for 40% in the graph. My visual and auditory learning skill are on the same level according to the results (both at 30%) but personally I think that I would lean more towards visual leaning than auditory as seeing how something is done is close to physically doing it. My auditory and visual results combined make up 60% which is a good thing as doing my studies online both of these are the main way I will be getting my information.</p>

  <p>3.	The Herman Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI) profile</p>
  <p>screen shot</p>
  <p>The HBDI test is designed to identify your thinking preferences. These two graphs show my thinking style normally (left graph) and under pressure (dotted line on right graph). There is very little difference between the results when under pressure or thinking normally which indicates that my thought process or thinking style is not overly impacted by being under pressure.</p>
  <p>The emotional response (C - red section) is the lowest of the four which can be both good and bad. The good side is that I am not likely to be led by emotion in my thinking, it will likely be more logical. The downside is that I may potentially offend someone as I make not be considering emotional aspects in my thought process.</p>
  <p>As shown in section B (green area), there is room for improvement in my organisation and planning. I do plan and organise tasks but I think I often put more focus on what I am doing at the time instead of thinking or planning ahead.</p>

  <p>The results of these three tests show that I am very hands on, have a high level of creativity and am not overly impacted when under pressure. From the results I think there are areas I could work on such as potentially being stubborn and stuck in my ways or not being empathetic enough. Based off these results I think it shows that I can work well in a team setting as I have good problem-solving skills and like to get in and do things. I think I would be able to fill any role within a team quite easily.</p>



<h1>Project Idea</h1>
  <p>I have always liked to tinker around with things since a young age. I would often hang out with my Grandad in his workshop when we visited and help him with whatever job he was working on at the time. I built my first computer when I was about 13 and my passion for IT grew from there. That’s partly how I came up with my idea.</p>
  <p>The IT project idea I came up with was to create a simple light controller that would allow you to create a light show using your Christmas lights. I enjoy hanging up Christmas lights each year and have seen the insane displays that flood social media over the festive period. I have always wanted to create an amazing light show like this but the commercially available equipment to do something like this is quite expensive. That’s when I discovered you can create a simple light controller using a Raspberry Pi and a few other bits and pieces for a fraction of the cost. I thought why not create different DIY hobby kits that are all based around using a Raspberry Pi, one of which would be the light controller for Christmas lights. As I have no real experience with creating something like this, my idea is something that would likely take me several years to complete as I still have quite a few skills to learn/develop first. Studying the Bachelor of Information Technology will help me learn some of the skills I need to be able to complete this. Otherwise I would need to get the help of a group of people to help with the coding and development of the app to control this.</p>
  <p>This idea is a fun creative project to build that I’m sure lots of Christmas light enthusiasts would enjoy, but it doesn’t just have to stop at being a light controller. It could be anything. Similar types of kits have been around for years and provide great learning opportunities. This idea could be expanded into an entire DIY/hobby kit range, using the Raspberry Pi as the main item and then selling different add-ons or software packages to create or do other things. But for now I am just going to focus on the light controller portion.</p>
  <p>I have never used a Raspberry Pi but from what I have read Raspberry Pi OS (previously known as Raspbian) sounds like a great operating system to start with as it includes quite a lot of tools built in. It is also officially supported by the Raspberry Pi Foundation so that gives some confidence in the stability of the OS. After looking into different languages you can use to code in on Raspberry Pi, I think python would be able to do what I need. It is supposed to be one of the easier languages to learn and is quite popular so I would likely be able to find plenty of support and resources to help create my idea. I think I would also need an expansion device for the Raspberry Pi called a PiFace. This device allows you to connect a number of different things to the Raspberry Pi such as lights. To connect the lights to the PiFace you have to cut the current light controller box off the Christmas lights and wire it direct to the PiFace board. Once the Raspberry Pi and PiFace is setup with the lights connected to it you would then be able to control it with an application.</p>
  <p>The latest version of Raspberry Pi includes network connectivity which means I won’t need any other hardware to be able to connect it to my home network. By using free software that already exists (VNC by Dexter Industries) I can make the Raspberry Pi accessible on any mobile/tablet on the same network. This way I wouldn’t need to create an app that needs to work on multiple platforms. The devices would be able to access and use the app on the Raspberry Pi kind of like a remote desktop.</p>
  <p>As I don’t have any real knowledge in coding yet I am unsure just how hard it would be to create the program to control the lights, but I have an idea of what I would want it to be able to do. Similar to what you would see in the software that controls the RGB in most computers, I would like to have some pre-set lighting patterns/styles that you could select. There would be a drop-down menu to select these options and then you would simply click a button to apply to the selected pattern. I would also like to make these pre-sets be slightly modifiable by the user by having a speed and brightness slider (where applicable). I would have the pre-set options available to just repeat the one option or randomly scroll through them all. The below image is a rough idea of how this may look.</p>
  <p>I would have an option for users to create a playlist of patterns. This would let users select which patterns they would like to have, the speed and brightness (if applicable to pattern), and the duration each pattern goes for before changing to the next. This playlist would then repeat. The below image is a rough idea of how this may look.</p>
  <p>The software would also have a scheduler. This would eliminate the need to manually turn the lights on or off and would mean that they could be scheduled to run on specific days and times. The below image is a rough idea of how this may look. </p>
  <p>The idea for a light controller may only appeal to a small audience but as just one of potentially limitless parts of a DIY/hobby kit this idea has unlimited potential.</p>
